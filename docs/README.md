### Introduction

Welcome to our Django-based Calendar Application documentation! This application is designed to provide a user interface for managing and displaying events based on dates. Leveraging the power of the Django framework, the application allows you to organize and visualize events in a calendar format. Whether you are planning schedules, tracking important dates, or managing events associated with other models, this application offers flexibility and ease of use.

**Key Features:**
- Create, edit, and delete events with relevant details such as title, description, start date, and end date.
- Connect events to other models within your Django project, enabling a versatile and extensible system.
- View events in a monthly calendar format, making it easy to visualize and manage schedules.
- Utilize the powerful `calendar` module in Python for date-related calculations on the backend.

This documentation will guide you through the setup, configuration, and usage of the application. Whether you are a developer integrating the calendar into an existing project or an end-user managing events, this guide aims to provide clear and comprehensive instructions.

Let's start by exploring the models used in the application.

### Managing Models

#### Event Model

The core of the Calendar Application is the `Event` model. This model represents individual events and contains the following fields:

- **title:** A short, descriptive title for the event.
- **start_date:** The date and time when the event starts.
- **end_date:** The date and time when the event ends.
- **description:** Additional details or information about the event.

Here is an example of how you can define the `Event` model in your `models.py` file:

```python
from django.db import models

class Event(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    start_date = models.DateField()
    end_date = models.DateField()
    description = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

#### Connecting Events to Other Models

If you have other models within your Django project that need to be associated with events, you can use ForeignKey relationships. For example, let's consider an `AltroModello` model connected to the `Event` model:

```python
class AltroModello(models.Model):
    event = models.ForeignKey(Event, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="altro_modello_events")
    data = models.DateField()
    # other fields of the model

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.data)
```

In this example, each instance of `AltroModello` is associated with an event through the `event` ForeignKey.
